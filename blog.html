                <p class="text-center ">Welcome to Spring! This special season is when the earth turns its slumber into reawakening. Each year, as we transition from the cold dormancy of Winter into the lively warmth of Spring, there is an undeniable sense of hope and optimism, along with the sweet scent of blossoms, in the air. The optimism of Spring is apparent in nature, as life begins again, and most importantly, its inherent within us. Allah (SWT) created us as creatures of worship—beings with an innate sense of inherent optimism and trust that His plan is unfolding, and that we get to be a part of it. When we place our trust in Allah (SWT), it puts our minds at ease, giving us less to worry about, and more to be optimistic about. These Hadiths are examples of how to live optimistically on your walk with Allah (SWT).</p>
